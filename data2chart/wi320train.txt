Roles and Responsibilities: 

[Operator]: Assemble the work and report the Inspection result of each workflow (from 320.001 to 320.005). 

[Lead]: Examine the captured snapshots and/or review the AI inspection report. 

[Virtual Assistant]: Provide guidance during the inspection and complete the Work Complete Form. 

Process Iteration: Direct the Operator on when and where to capture the Inspection Snapshots (see document #WI-035 Virtual Assistant Workflow). 

 

Work Complete Form: Document the procedure and inspection outcomes in compliance with CFR Regulatory Requirements. The Work Completion Form corresponds to document #WI-033 Bot-Assisted Work Completion Log. 

Workflow 

320.001 Affix Safety Screw 

 

[Operator]  

Use #S047 (Soldering Station) to solder #3012 (Safety Screw) to #3010 (Raspberry Pi Pico). 
Ensure there are no soldering defects. 
Ensure the position of the Safety Screw is correct. 
Do not use an un-marked screw when processing this step. 
Verify that the lens is securely attached to the adapter board. 

 

Inspection: 

Check if there is a presence of both #3012 (Safety Screw) and #3010 (Raspberry Pi Pico) 

 
 

320.002 Connect Flex PCB Connector Strips 

Attach #3009 (Flex PCB Connector Strips) to the appropriate connectors on the adapter board #3008. 
Ensure a secure connection between the flex PCB connector strips and the adapter board. 
Do not process this step before completing 320.001. 
Do not use PCB connector strips of the wrong color. 
Check for any loose connections or misalignments. 

 

Inspection targets: 

Check if there is a presence of #3009 (Flex PCB Connector Strips) and #3008 (Adapter Board). 

 
 

320.003 Attach Adapter Board to Raspberry Pi 

Place #3008 (Adapter Board) onto the Raspberry Pi board #3010. 
Ensure proper alignment of connectors on both boards. 
Do not open #3011 Lens in this step. 
Do not use undocumented materials to clean Lens in this step. 
Avoid damaging any electronic components during this process. 
 
 

Inspection targets: 
Check if there is a presence of #3012 (Safety Screw), #3010 (Raspberry Pi Pico), #3008 (Adapter Board), and #3009 (Flex PCB Connector Strips). 

 

320.004 Final Inspection 

Visually inspect the entire assembly for any defects. 
Ensure there are no loose connections, soldering defects, or visible contaminants on the lens. 
Verify that all components are securely attached. 
 

Inspection targets: 

Check if there is a presence of clean #3011 Lens. 
 

320.005 Affix Label/Completion 

Labeling: attach #S050 (Tag Label) to the unit with the appropriate identification. 

 
Include relevant information such as serial numbers, batch numbers, and production date. 
 

Ensure compliance with CFR21 labeling requirements. 
Record all relevant information and documentation regarding the assembly process. 
 
Inspection Target: 

Check if there is a presence of #S050 (Tag Label). 
 

Safety Precautions - CFR21 

Always wear safety goggles when soldering. 
Use #S039 lens rinsing fluids in a well-ventilated area. 
Avoid touching the soldering iron tip directly. 
Be cautious of sharp edges on components. 
Ensure the work area is clean and organized to prevent accidents. 
 

Quality Control - CFR21 

Ensure all connections are secure. 
Verify that the lens is clean and free from any contaminants. 
Confirm that there are no soldering defects. 
Test the Raspberry Pi board for proper functionality after assembly.
