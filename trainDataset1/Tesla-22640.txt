alert, with improper output from switchpack
Description
"Check left/right front turn signal bulb" alert, with improper output from switchpack.
Steps to Test
Check fuse 7.
Measure the voltage at the turn signal switch connector (Left FHC9 - pin 49AL)(Right FHC9 - pin 49AR).
Bridge the appropriate terminals to bypass the turn signal switch.
Steps to Fix
Replace the fuse if damaged.
If the voltage does not equal 12V, check/repair the wiring/connectors.
If the signal operates while bypassing the turn signal switch, replace the switch (Part# 2000253). Otherwise,
check/repair the wiring/connectors.
